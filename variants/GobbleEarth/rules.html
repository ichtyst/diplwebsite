 on the standard map of Diplomacy, Gobble-Earth adds the rest of the 
world to the fight for hegemony. According to the borders of 1914 and 
the map drawing principles of standard this variant has seven more 
powers starting out the competition at a local basis against the 
colonial empires of Europe. Can you gobble up the others?</p>
<p><i>A larger map, useful as a printed version that also contain all full names, can be found at</i> http://www.malmobiketours.se/Bilder/GobbleEarth.jpg</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: vDiplomacy will NOT tell you which builds are 
legal and which are not. It is very important to keep track of the 
colonial build rule and remember yourself which of the builds vDiplomacy
 lists are actually possible.</b></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Variant rules:</b></p>
<p><i>The main rule difference is that this variant has two kinds of 
builds. Home builds are standard builds, units instantly built in your 
home centers (your square centers). Colonial builds are delayed builds, 
built in any center (circle centers and other's home centers).</i></p>

<p>The victory condition is 37 SC (~35%)</p>

<p>Like Kiel in standard, Panama and Cairo also have canals.</p>

<p>Home centers are only the centers in a country's core area; other 
starting possessions are considered neutral for building purposes. On 
this map the home centers are marked as squares and the neutrals as 
circles. Home centers belong to one power so it is not possible to do 
instant builds anywhere else than your own home centers.</p>

<p>To raise units far from home any nation can do a colonial build 
instead of a usual one. Colonial builds can be ordered by any power in 
any center. For a colonial build to succeed the building power must have
 enough centers to order the build, as well as having waived (the order 
"Do not use build order") one building capacity the winter one year 
prior for each colonial build.</p>

<p><b>You have to keep track of the colonial build rule yourself! 
vDiplomacy will give you the option of ordering illegal builds, but they
 WILL FAIL!</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Some useful hints to remember:</b></p>
<p><b>DO NOT</b> try to build in your colonies 1901. It is the first year, how could you possibly have saved build from last year?<br>
<b>DO NOT</b> try to build in a colony as if it was home just because 
you happened to start with it. China (Urumtsi), Japan (Seoul), Turkey 
(Mecca, Baghdad), Russia (Samarkand, Irkutsk, Vladivostok) and USA 
(Fairbanks, Honolulu, Manila) should be especially careful to remember 
they start with colonies, but also the European empires must remember 
this (anything overseas).<br>
<b>DO NOT</b> order two colonial builds if you only saved one build last year. You must save one build per unit.<br>
<b>DO NOT</b> order a colonial build if you saved the build two years 
ago. If you do not use your saved build the year after you saved it you 
must start over with saving it again.<br>
<b>DO NOT</b> order a colonial build if you ordered an illegal build 
that failed last year. Even though you didn't raise the unit, it does 
not count as a waive.</p>

<p>If you are still unsure about colonial builds, take a look at the 
examples below. You can also use this flowchart: 
http://www.malmobiketours.se/Bilder/Gobble%20build%20flowchart.jpg</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Colonial build example 1:</strong></p>
<p>Powers A, B and C all increase from 6 to 7 SC in year 1.</p>

<p><b>W 1901</b></p>

<p>A<br>
Waive</p>

<p>B <br>
Build at home</p>

<p>C<br>
Waive</p>
<br>
<p>In year 2, A stays on 7 SC, B increase to 8 SC and C decrease to 6 SC.</p>

<p><b>W 1902</b></p>

<p>A<br>
Can build at home or colonially</p>

<p>B<br>
Can only build at home</p>

<p>C<br>
Cannot build</p>

<p>So since A had waived last year she can build a colonial unit. A can 
also choose to build at home, but must then waive again if she wants to 
build colonially later. B did not waive last year and can only build at 
home (or waive for a build 1903). C did waive, but does not longer have 
the required SC to build anything.</p>

<p><strong>Colonial build example 2:</strong></p>
<p><i>Making a colonial build</i></p>
<p> W 1901. England increases from 13 to 15 SC.<br>
  + F London<br>
  Waive</p>
<p>W 1902. England increases to 16 SC. England can do one colonial in 
any owned SC and one home build for the new SC. (May of course waive the
 new one to build colonially 1903 or England may build both at home as 
well).<br>
  + F Vancouver<br>
  + F Liverpool</p>
<p><br>
<i>Not making a colonial build.</i></p>
<p>W 1901. England increases from 13 to 15 SC.<br>
  + F London<br>
  + F Liverpool</p>
<p>W 1902. England increases to 16 SC. England cannot do a colonial build as there was no waive last year.<br>
  + F London</p>
<p><br>
<i>Failing a colonial build.</i></p>
<p>W 1901. England increases from 13 to 15 SC.<br>
  + F London<br>
  Waive</p>
<p>W 1902. England falls back to 14 SC.
  No build anywhere due to lack of SCs.<br>

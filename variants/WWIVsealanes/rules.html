<li><b>Home supply centers:</b><br>Units may be built on any vacant supply center that has been held for a fall. (i.e. all supply centers controlled by players are considered their "home supply centers" for the purpose of building units)</li>
<li><b>The first turn: builds</b><br>The game starts with a build phase for every power.</li>
<li><b>Special kick-out after first build:</b><br>If a player does not check in during the first build phase his status is immediately set to "Left" and the country gets a "default build" so another player can take over in this early stage.</li>
<li><b>Globe:</b><br>The map is a globe, so you can leave the map on the left side and enter at the right side.</li>
<p><b>The Overseer Zones and Sea Lanes</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b>There is now a new subdivision of ocean zones: they fall into 2 categories the overseer zone <b>(OZ)</b> and the sea lanes <b>(SL)</b></p>
<p><b>2.</b> OZs are designated with a rectangle around their abbreviation - only one unit can be in an OZ at any one time. The area that they oversee is delineated by a solid line. OZs are adjacent to their neighbouring OZs and territories - both land and sea - as in the original WWIV variant. OZs are also adjacent to the SLs that that border them.</p>
<p>ie. GOA is adjacent to:</p> 
<p>OZs: NCP, NCP</p>
<p>SLs: Nth. NCP, Wst. NCP, N.W. NEP, N.E. NEP, Wst. GOA, Sth. GOA, Est GoA</li>
<p>Territories: CAS, BRG, ANC</p>
<p><b>3.</b>Sea lanes are adjacent to the SLs that fall within their overseen zone, their immediate neighbouring territories (sea and land) and any OZs that they are adjacent to</li>
<p>ie. N.E. NEP is adjacent to:</p>
<p>S.E. NEP, S.W. NEP, N.W. NEP, SthGOA, GOA, EstGOA, CAS, SF, LA, NEP</li>
<p><b>The following are some visual examples of how the OZs & SLs work</b></p>
<p>The overseer zone GLP is still accessible to LIM:<p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Sealanes within an OZ are adjacent to each other:<p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp7.jpg"/></p>
<p>Fleets can occupy both the OZ and its SLs at the same time:</p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp2.jpg"/></p>
<p>OZs can still convoy as per normal:</p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp3.jpg"/></p>
<p>Sea Lanes can convoy irrespective of who owns the OZ:</p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp6.jpg"/></p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp4.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additional routes for convoying now exist:</p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp5.jpg"/></p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp8.jpg"/></p>
<p>OZs can also support convoys made from sea lanes:</p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp9.jpg"/></p>
<p>Even though islands cannot convoy - their sea lanes are able to do so:</p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp11.jpg"/></p>
<p>Care should be taken as to potential retreats:</p>
<p><img src="variants/WWIVsealanes/resources/samp10.jpg"/></p>

<p>Hopefully this variant will provide more fluid dynamics in the sea regions. This variant arose from a discussion held in 2010, based around how to make sea regions in Diplomacy more flexible, as well as the issue of continental fortress politics. It's been a long time coming so enjoy! </p>
